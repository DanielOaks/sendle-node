Order tracking gives the public details associated with a **Sendle order** based on the orderâ€™s Sendle Reference as a search key (as `ref` below).

The API response returns two sections as described below. Order tracking does not contain personal location information.

```ts
const ref = 'S3ND73';

const tracking = await client.tracking(ref);
```

**Response:**
